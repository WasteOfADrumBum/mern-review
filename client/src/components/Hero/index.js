            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In 2020, an astounding 97% of customers
            reported reading online reviews before making a purchase. Customers
            read an average of seven reviews before trusting a company. Nearly
            half of those will only choose to use a business or product that has
            a rating 4-stars or higher. As if those numbers arenâ€™t enough, a
            shocking 88% of consumers trust online reviews as much as personal
            recommendations. No need to ask around your social network when
            there are plenty of credible reviews to scour over online.
